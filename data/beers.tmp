Soba (also known as buckwheat) is not a type of wheat but a member of the rhubard family (a fruit, not a grain!) Soba has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).

Morimoto Soba Ale is brewed with Roasted Buckwheat, Pale malt, Munich Malt, 13-17 Carastan Malt, and Crystal Hops. (Note, this beer contains Gluten.) The flavor is unique, toasty-nutty sensation with medium body and good hop bitterness. Morimoto Soba Ale is available in a 22 ounce silkscreened bottle and 13.2 gallon sankey kegs.

This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first.

There is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine.","2010-07-22 20:00:20"

India Pale Ale dates back to the 1700â€™s when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice.

Hop Henge Imperial IPA returns to the Bond Street Series line-up this April in extreme fashion. Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€™s monument to hops.

Head Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.

The team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.

Limited Availability April through June.

Donâ€™t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.

Available April through June.

Hop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.

Like the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.

Alcohol By Volume: 8.1%
	

IBU 95

When one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.

5 out 5 stars 
Hop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.
â€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€
It pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€™s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.
In addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.
This was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€
â€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.

Well hang onto your boot straps because Scratch #11 is about as close as we can get to the original ESB without firing up the old brew kettle. The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chrisâ€™ stint at Englandâ€™s University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chrisâ€™ experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.

The Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones.

To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.

We used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.

A typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.

It features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.

We brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Coloradoâ€™s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.

Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.

We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hopsâ€¦ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced.

Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.

Our efforts do not go unrewarded â€“ Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness.

But there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. 

Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style.

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops.

That thoughtâ€”and an itchy wool robeâ€”sustained the monks through times of fasting. Their reward? A bock beer with the power to rejuvenate the body and the soul. That, and the opportunity to exchange the wool robe for a nice burlap one. 

So when youâ€™re stuck in the middle of that seemingly endless glass of mediocre beer, be optimistic. A Dundee Pale Bock awaits.

Dundee Porter is a throwback to a different eraâ€”when times were tough and so were the people. They drank big beers, slapped each other on the back, and toasted the good lifeâ€”even though they only saw it from a distance. 

With Dundee Porter, you can get a taste of it.

Big and malty flavor from aromatic dark-roasted grains balanced by a subtle hint of hops. Deep color and rich caramel flavor.","2010-07-22 20:00:20"

Sometimes, being unclearâ€”and a little flexibleâ€”is a good thing. Like when you are looking for the perfect refreshment. Dundee Wheat Beer combines wheat and yeast into a refreshing hefeweizen-style brew. Unfiltered, so it is slightly cloudy and pleasantly unclear. 

So the next time youâ€™re convinced youâ€™re right about what youâ€™ve been drinking, give a little â€œunclarityâ€ a try.

An American-style, unfiltered wheat beer. Pale straw in color with a light cloudiness from carefully selected wheat and yeast. Pleasant spicy malt aroma and a crisp hop finish.","2010-07-22 20:00:20"

Dundee Pale Ale understands the secret of the hop flowerâ€”the power to turn an ordinary beer into something extraordinary. 

And the power to make you indescribably hoppy. 

A wonderfully balanced true pale ale. Cascade, Tomahawk, and Amarillo hops create a citrusy aroma with a smooth, crisp finish. A subdued malt character nicely complements the hop complexity and produces an orangey amber hue.","2010-07-22 20:00:20"

Face it, modern life demands a little bitterness every once in a while. 

When you are in the mood for something bitter, Dundee IPA is hop bitterness at its finest. As the youngsters would say, thatâ€™s sweet.

ESB's reputation was soon enhanced after being named CAMRA's (Campaign for Real Ale) Beer of the Year in 1978, and the beer has not stopped winning since!

Consider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience.

For Scratch #19, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.

Some stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.

So for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff. Enjoy!","2010-07-22 20:00:20"

Our first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo, and, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwandaâ€™s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.

At the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasnâ€™t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam.

True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to â€œthe originalâ€ pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hopâ€™s pleasant, spicy tone.

The cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always rightâ€” temperature, glass, presentation. 

â€œNo hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.â€ 

Gruit is an old styleâ€”one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times.

This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings.

Wet hop beers are brewed using fresh, â€œwetâ€ hops instead of traditional dried hopsâ€”hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked.

Typically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.
This yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.

Harpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested â€œwetâ€ hops.","2010-07-22 20:00:20"

Although no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here, weâ€™ve brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice, as well as two malts.

Rice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops weâ€™ve added. Lots and lots of them. We then dry-hopped this Double IPA with even more-generous additions of Chinook and Citra hops to create a nose that hints at tangerine, mango, papaya and pine.","2010-07-22 20:00:20"
